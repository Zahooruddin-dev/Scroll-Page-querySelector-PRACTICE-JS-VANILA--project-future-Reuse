Smooth Scroll: Clicking on navigation links will smoothly scroll to the corresponding section of the page.
Dynamic "Back to Top" Button: A "back to top" button appears after scrolling down the page, allowing users to quickly return to the top.
Current Year Display: The footer automatically updates to display the current year, ensuring that the site stays up-to-date without manual changes.
